# Simple Work Tracker

---

## Description

This is a small applicaton to help automate *roughly* track the amount of time I spend on some task or ticket at work.
The utility is design to be super simple that will allow a user to start a new task time until the user requests a close.
When closed more information can be added and be saved locally to a machine. Once saved it can be accessed or setup to remind 
for a time to send a parsed readable format to a user to report the time spend in a given timeframe.
